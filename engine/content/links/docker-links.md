### Core

- [Dockerfile Project](https://github.com/dockerfile) Trusted Automated Docker Builds
- [Docker GitHub repositories](https://github.com/docker)


### Libraries

- [docker/libcompose](https://github.com/docker/libcompose) A Go library for Docker Compose. It does everything the command-line tool does, but from within Go: read Compose files, start them, scale them, etc.


### Management

- [Panamax: Docker Management for Humans](http://panamax.io/) An open-source project that makes deploying complex containerized apps as easy as Drag-and-Drop.
- [citadel/citadel](https://github.com/citadel/citadel) A toolkit for building a distributed docker cluster, [http://citadeltoolkit.org](http://citadeltoolkit.org)
- [Shipyard](http://shipyard-project.com/) Composable Docker Management. Built on the Docker cluster management toolkit Citadel, Shipyard gives you the ability to manage Docker resources including containers, hosts and more.

### Tools

- [Yelp/dockersh](https://github.com/Yelp/dockersh) A shell which places users into individual docker containers 
- [DRAY](http://dray.it/): Docker Workflow Engine. UNIX pipes for Docker. Dray allows users to separate a workflow into discrete steps each to be handled by a single container. This isolation makes efficient use of compute resources and also allows workflows to be easily changed, extended or re-composed via this loosely coupled architecture. 

### Documentation

- [The Docker Guidebook](http://kencochrane.net/blog/2013/08/the-docker-guidebook/) The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to Docker, show you what it can do, and how to get it up and running on your system, and how to use it to make your life better.
