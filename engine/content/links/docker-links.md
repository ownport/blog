### Core

- [Dockerfile Project](https://github.com/dockerfile) Trusted Automated Docker Builds
- [Docker GitHub repositories](https://github.com/docker)


### Libraries

- [docker/libcompose](https://github.com/docker/libcompose) A Go library for Docker Compose. It does everything the command-line tool does, but from within Go: read Compose files, start them, scale them, etc.


### Management

- [Panamax: Docker Management for Humans](http://panamax.io/) An open-source project that makes deploying complex containerized apps as easy as Drag-and-Drop.
- [citadel/citadel](https://github.com/citadel/citadel) A toolkit for building a distributed docker cluster, [http://citadeltoolkit.org](http://citadeltoolkit.org)
- [Shipyard](http://shipyard-project.com/) Composable Docker Management. Built on the Docker cluster management toolkit Citadel, Shipyard gives you the ability to manage Docker resources including containers, hosts and more.

### Tools

- [Yelp/dockersh](https://github.com/Yelp/dockersh) A shell which places users into individual docker containers 
- [DRAY](http://dray.it/): Docker Workflow Engine. UNIX pipes for Docker. Dray allows users to separate a workflow into discrete steps each to be handled by a single container. This isolation makes efficient use of compute resources and also allows workflows to be easily changed, extended or re-composed via this loosely coupled architecture.
