- [scrapinghub/portia](https://github.com/scrapinghub/portia) is a tool that allows you to visually scrape websites without any programming knowledge required. With Portia you can annotate a web page to identify the data you wish to extract, and Portia will understand based on these annotations how to scrape data from similar pages.
