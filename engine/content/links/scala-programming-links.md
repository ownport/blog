### Core

- [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/index.html) The interactive build tool. Use Scala to define your tasks. Then run them in parallel from the shell.
- [Scala standard library](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html)


### Documentation

- [Scala Guides and Overviews](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/)


### Tests

- With [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/), you can test either Scala or Java code. By offering deep integration with tools such as JUnit, TestNG, Ant, Maven, sbt, ScalaCheck, JMock, EasyMock, Mockito, ScalaMock, Selenium, Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ, ScalaTest makes it easy to take your testing to a higher, more productive level in new or existing Scala or Java projects.

### Blogs

- [](http://alvinalexander.com/) This website, alvinalexander.com, was created by Alvin J. Alexander way back in 1998. The original plan was to open it up to all sorts of writers, create forums, and all sorts of other things, but alas, other things like economics kicked in. (I had to get a real job, and founded (and then sold) Mission Data.) Author of books: Scala Cookbook, How I sold My Business, A Survival Guide for New Consultants
