### Core

- [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/index.html) The interactive build tool. Use Scala to define your tasks. Then run them in parallel from the shell.
- [Scala standard library](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html)

### Tests

- With [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/), you can test either Scala or Java code. By offering deep integration with tools such as JUnit, TestNG, Ant, Maven, sbt, ScalaCheck, JMock, EasyMock, Mockito, ScalaMock, Selenium, Eclipse, NetBeans, and IntelliJ, ScalaTest makes it easy to take your testing to a higher, more productive level in new or existing Scala or Java projects.

### Libraries

- [json4s/json4s](https://github.com/json4s/json4s)  A single AST to be used by other scala json libraries [http://json4s.org](http://json4s.org)
